# pass exporter

This pile of bash one-liners will facilitate exporting a password database from [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org) to a [1password](https://support.1password.com/import-mac/) compatible CSV file. 

It's using grep to filter a yaml file, and it's mostly based on my own personal pass repo which might not match your personal format.
